        <h1>My Experience</h1>
        <p>I've worked in many different industries throughout my life. I've been a <strong>personal trainer</strong> working for some of the <em>most prominent gyms</em> in the state. I've also been a <strong>welder's helper</strong> working for <em>So-Cal Gas Company</em>. Not long after that, I went to college for welding and became a <strong>pipe welder</strong> for <em>ESYS Energy Control Company</em>. I was also a <strong>Twitch streamer</strong> for many games such as <em>Runescape</em>, <em>Kingdom Come Deliverance</em>, and <em>Escape from Tarkov</em>. My most recent work was as a <strong>pipe-fitter</strong> for the <em>LOCAL 460 P.I.P.E Trades</em>.</p>
