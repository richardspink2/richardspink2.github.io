        <p><h1><strong>My Name is Richard Spink</strong></h1>
            <p>I was born in <em>Portland, OR</em>, and moved all over the country. I learned that <strong>coding</strong> was something I wanted to do <strong>15 years ago</strong> while playing on a modded <em>Battlefield 2</em> called <strong>Project Reality</strong>. It is now known as <strong>Squad</strong>.</p>
    
            <p>I am now enrolled in the <strong>College of Western Idaho's software development program</strong> where I will be rigorously studying the different <strong>code languages</strong> offered to me to broaden my fields of expertise.</p></p>
